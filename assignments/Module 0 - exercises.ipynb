    "In [The Library of Babel](https://sites.evergreen.edu/politicalshakespeares/wp-content/uploads/sites/226/2015/12/Borges-The-Library-of-Babel.pdf), the Argentinian writer Jorge Louis Borges imagines a universe where people are born and live inside a giant library that contains an astronomical number of books. Each book:\n",
