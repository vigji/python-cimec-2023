# Submission of final project

The final assignment of the course consists in a small Python project, ideally something that could be useful for your work or some extra-curricular endeavior. 

If you have already some half-backed or questionably written project going on, expanding and refactoring would also be suitable ideas!

### Format
The project should be **uploaded to a public repository in your GitHub**, that will be the only accepted submission form! (There will be a class about publishing code on GitHub). If you have concerns about leaving it open, let us know and we can discuss it!

### Project content
Depending on the project, it could consist of one or more notebooks, and/or (encouraged) functions and classes defined in separate `.py` modules.

Make sure you **thoroughly document your code**! Try to write self-explanatory code (meaningful variables names, logical flow...) and add the comments you feel necessary. It shouldn't just work, it should be readable - it is a good chance to try doing that well, as you will get feedback about it! If you write notebooks, make sure you use the markdown cells to describe the notebook content and to add all the required explanations to the analysis flow.

The project **must** feature a `README.md` in the repository with a (schematic) description of the project aims and structure.

Examples of reasonable projects:
 - Writing a loading class for an experiment with multiple data sources
 - Drafting the analysis of a dataset (with data loading, operations, plot generation...)
 - Implementing a new experiment / preparing the material for an experiment (eg images)
 - Refactoring some old code you wrote before knowing about classes and avoding magic numbers (refactoring should be conceptual and not only cosmetic! Thinking about avoiding duplicated code, thinking forward about usability of the functions and classes, etc.)


### Final presentations
We will organize a day for chilled, short (5 min) presentations of everyone's project after all people have submitted. There will be prizes (and beer)!
